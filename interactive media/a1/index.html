    <em><h2 style="color: aliceblue;">1 - What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2></em>

    <p style="color: aliceblue;">The first thing I noticed when I opened the page was that the title "7 Poems by Justine Nguyễn-Nguyễn" changed from large to small and moved from the centre to the top right corner of the screen. So I decided to try interacting with the title of the page.

         <ul class="liststyle">
          <li> Click on the title of the page to see if there is an interaction.</li>
          <li>Click on the first green rectangle in the top left corner.</li>
          <li>Read the words shown in order on the green card.</li>
          <li>Click on the green card and see the poem stop showing with the word staying on the card.</li>
          <li> Click on the other green rectangles to read the poem.</li>
          <li> Notice that every time the text pops up a note follows.</li>
          <li> Start playing and pausing the poem on each card randomly and quickly, trying to hear the melody.</li>
          <li>Feel a bit noisy and click on mute in the top right corner.</li>
          <li>Move the mouse over the icon in the bottom right corner consisting of two rectangles crossed.</li>
          <li> Find out it's a page leading to another website and move my mouse away.</li>
          <li> Click on the card to play and try to read the poem through.</li>
          <li>I found that I can't read it and start clicking and pausing the 7 cards in order.</li>

      <em><h2 style="color: aliceblue;">3 - What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">I spent a long time trying to read and understand the verses played on the little cards, trying to find patterns in them and finish the poem.

      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The most action I did was to repeatedly click on the 7 little cards, play the poem and pause the poem.

      <em><h2 style="color: aliceblue;">5 - What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">I think my Intended primary goal on this page is 7 poems. Once I started to read the poems carefully, I noticed that each poem only had a few sentences and then the text of the card playing would start to repeat. Because the poems were so short, I even wondered if it was possible that the 7 poems needed to be read together to form one poem.

     <section style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" id="ONE" class="section">
   
      <em><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">6 - What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The makers have chosen to make the text pop out in the form of a text card, allowing the reader to read the poem word by word. This presentation does succeed in making seven poems of different lengths occupy the same size on the same page evenly, which is very clever. However, it was a little difficult to read word by word, and the speed at which the text popped up caused me to read the poems several times to understand what was going on.

     <section style="background-color: black;" id="ONE" class="section">
   
      <em><h2 style="color: aliceblue;">7 -  What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">The first thing I noticed and read when I opened the site was the name of the site, then the 7 rectangles. For at least the first 30 seconds, the user spends clicking on the rectangle to expand it and learn the basic function of the expanded word cards. Once the user finds out that these are word cards that loop through the 7 poems in conjunction with the clues given by the website name, they want to read through the poems. After about a minute of finding the poem difficult to read, the user will repeat the text in a constant clicking on play and pause, and try to restructure the different characters from the 7 poems that are resting on the screen.

     <section style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" id="ONE" class="section">
   
      <em><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">8 - What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The initial point of bringing the user's attention to the headings is, in my opinion, very successful, but then it comes to the main content of the page. It would have been very difficult for the designer to get the reader to read all seven poems. At the beginning of the interaction with the word cards the user is confused and is trying to explore everything on the screen without paying attention to the content of the poems. Over time, once the user has explored the basic features of the web page, they will simply fix their eyes more on the characters displayed in front of them on the screen.The disadvantage of having seven poems balanced on the page also arises in that the user cannot fully concentrate on one poem and the user is bound to expand several rectangles at once.When the rectangles are expanded, the user cannot interactively change back into rectangles, which makes it more difficult for the user to read a poem in its entirety.

     <section style="background-color: black;" id="ONE" class="section">
   
      <em><h2 style="color: aliceblue;">9 - What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">The name of the site identifies "7 poems", a reference to the poetic form of expression. In the way the main content is displayed, it refers to the word cards that we use when learning English or playing games.​​In the icon in the lower right-hand corner, the author gives the two crossed rectangles that make it up different movement speeds, which reference the way the clock runs.

      <em><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">10 - What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Because the title of the website references poetry, which is often rich in meaning, I will read each poem, and even each sentence, several times. The most important feature of the word cards is that each card is an individual word, which can be combined in any way you like, changing the order or reading order to form different sentences. That is what I did when I interacted with this page, pausing randomly to show words from the 7 poems and combining them to make sense of them. The reference to the clock lets me know that when I mouse over the Icon as if I were manipulating the time, the two rectangles, like the minute and second hands, start to move quickly, almost like I'm tweaking the clock.

      <em><h2 style="color: aliceblue;">11 - What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">I will interact with this website with a mind of reading poetry, think in detail and analyse the meaning of words and even symbols with a calm mentality. The word cards are designed so that the page is not just limited to reading 7 poems, I can create new lines with multiple clicks, which is fascinating to me. At the same time, the reference to the clock makes me see the slow flow of time, giving me a sense of being able to slow down and savour the present moment.

      <em><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">12 - What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What annoyed me the most is the design of the site in terms of sound. Instead of using natural sounds or the sounds of a single instrument the site has chosen to sound like a machine breaking down. It makes me dizzy to hear this sound for long periods of time, so most of the time I choose to mute it.

      <em><h2 style="color: aliceblue;">13 - What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?
      </h2></em>
  
      <p style="color: aliceblue;">My favourite element is the author's overall layout of the seven poems; the seven rectangular squares are spread out in a 2-3-2 pattern, not spreading out the image very much but forming a firm shape that gives the page a good sense of balance.
